# Final_project

## Overview

### Our group has selected basketball as our project topic because there are important features to the sport where data analytics can bring a deeper understanding to what goes into each game. 

## Data

### Our database consists of three main sources: season stats spanning from 1950 to 2017, player personal information, and player college information. We have joined the data on player name and from there we will be analyzing key metrics such as player averages, team averages, best seasons, and best players. We will be doing our main analysis off of the season stats data source and bringing in the other two for complimentary data analysis. We have divided the data into five different time periods: 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1985, 1986-1999, and 2000-2017.

## Questions to answer

1. Who are the top 10 players in points, rebounds, and assists over each decade?
2. Is there a correlation between where a player went to college and how they perform?
3. Can a player's height, weight, and position predict their season statistics?
4. Are there types of players that appear in earlier decades that do not appear in later decades?

## Milestones

1. Decided on Basketball as our sport to analyze as well as data sources
2. Created ERD for how we'd like our data to be joined
3. Divided the data into subsets for each team member to begin to create takeaways
3. Began to discuss which aspects of our data would be a good fit for machine learning
