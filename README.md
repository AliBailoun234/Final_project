# Final_project

## Overview

### Our group has selected basketball as our project topic because there are important features to the sport where data analytics can bring a deeper understanding to what goes into each game.

## Data

### Our database consists of three main sources: season stats spanning from 1950 to 2017, player personal information, and player college information. We have joined the data on player name and from there we will be analyzing key metrics such as player averages, team averages, best seasons, and best players. We will be doing our main analysis off of the season stats data source and bringing in the other two for complimentary data analysis.
